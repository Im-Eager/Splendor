Game Rules:

The game will begin and the first player to move will be randomly assigned.


Each player on their turn have three possible moves:

    1) Buy a card (if you have enough ressources for it) from the deck or your hand.

    2) Hold a card (the card will be in your hand, and other players will not be able to see it or buy it.)

    3) Get ressources from Bank. (You can get three ressources of different colors, or two ressources of the same color.)


The cards each player can buy have points (0-5) and can also be mines of ressources.

To buy a card, the player must pay its value with his tokens. 
Each mine the player has couts as one token.

To win the game, a player must accumulate a total of 15 points.
